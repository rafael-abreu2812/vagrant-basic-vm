# vagrant-basic-vm

Hi there!

This file it's a basic learning of Vagrant and Infrastructure as Code!

The file named "Vagrantfile", you'll find the specifications for a deploy of a local Virtual Machine, with a network configuration and a bash script for NGINX installation.

In this file, I configured Vagrant to sync a folder from the local machine (which contains a basic application of a calculator) to the VM inside the /var/www/html directory.
